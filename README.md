# Linux3
## Main Objective:
Your objective is to find a flag hidden in the folder of flags within this directory. In theory, you have 2 ways you could get the answer.

1) get really lucky and guess which of the 1001 flags is the correct one
2) follow the series of steps in order to be lead to the correct flag.

I would recommend #2 and if that's your choice, go in the step1 folder and follow your first set of directions.
